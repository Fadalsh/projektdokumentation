# VIVO-based Research Information Platform for the Berlin University Alliance
We are developing a platform for presenting structured, transparent, categorized, and linked information about researchers and their research activities within the framework of the Berlin University Alliance (BUA). This work aims at improving the discoverability of expertise, connecting researchers to their work across disciplines and boundaries, and facilitating new research collaborations. The platform is established using the open-source, web-based VIVO software.

## Duration
The current phase runs for 2.5 years, until Dec. 31, 2023.
